Sylvia by Shel Silverstein

Sylvia loves me,
Sylvia cares,
Sylvia picks me peaches and pears.
Sylvia offers me candy and Cokes,
Sylvia listens and laughs at me jokes.
Sylvia helps when I get in a fight,
Sylvia does all my homework at night.
Sylvia misses me,
Sylvia cries,
Sylvia thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Sylvia is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Sylvia just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Sylvia's hand,
In the darkness where Sylvia usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Sylvia's gone!
